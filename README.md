I started this project because I had switched from Spotify to YouTube Premium.

I didn't want to manually add all songs in my playlists one by one onto YouTube playlists. So, I thought I would use my coding knowledge to make my life easier.
Plus, I think it would be a good small project for my portfolio.

Sadly enough, Spotify only allows upto 100 tracks per API request. So, if the playlist has more than 100 songs, then there will be complications to encounter.


To use this, you will need to replace some of key components for the code to run properly. I will include instructions on how to obtain all key components.
